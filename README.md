# SpreeSlider

Add a slider to the homepage of your Spree site, and manage the slideshow from within the Admin panel.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_slider', github: 'stefansenk/spree_slider'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_slider:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_slider/factories'
```

## Using the slider

Spree 3 uses the bootstrap framework and a default slider template is available for bootstrap 3
`spree/shared/_slider.html.erb`.

Example usage:

```erb
  <%= render partial: 'spree/shared/slider', locals: { slider: Spree::Slide.published, cid: 'home', interval: false } %>
```

If you desire to have a customized carousel template you can specify your own like so:

```erb
<% if Spree::Slide.published.count > 0 %>
  <section id="slideshow">
    <ul class="slide">
      <% Spree::Slide.published.order('position ASC').each do |s| %>
        <li>
          <h1><%= s.slide_name %></h1>
          <%= link_to image_tag(main_app.url_for(ss.slide_image), url_for(s.link_url) %>
        </li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
    <a title="<%= t(:previous) %>" class="slider-prev"><%= t(:previous)%></a>
    <a title="<%= t(:next) %>" class="slider-next"><%= t(:next) %></a>
  </section>
<% end %>
```

## Dynamic content management

To add dynamic content, go to the spree admin section, under 'Configuration'
and find the Spree Slider & Spree Slider Locations menu.

You can create new slides and new locations. Then to fetch & render the slider for a particular location you can do the following:

```erb
  <% slides = Spree::Slide.published.location("home") %>
  <%= render partial: 'spree/shared/slider', locals: { slider: slides } %>
```
